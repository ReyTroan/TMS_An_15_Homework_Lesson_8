In the "lesson8" directory there are 3 folders with homework, on fixing the topic "Interfaces and abstract classes"

There was a task in the "part1" folder: to write a hierarchy of "Shapes" classes
- Make the Shape class abstract, with one abstract method for calculating the area of the shape and one abstract method for calculating the perimeter. 
- Calculate the area for each type of shape and
calculate the perimeter.
- Create an array of 5 shapes.
Walk through the array in a loop and display a plane on the screen for each shape from the array.
- Display the sum of the perimeters of all shapes in the array.

In the folder "part1_2" there was a task: to create classes "Director", "Employee", "Accountant".
- Implement an interface with a method that prints the position name, and implement this method into the created classes.
And also improve task 1.
- Use the Sealed modifier for the "Shape" class.

In the folder "part_2" there was a task: to finalize the task from homework No. 5 "Multiplication of two matrices"
- Create a Utils class.
- In this class, create a static method to display the matrix on the screen using System.out.println.
- The method should take a two-dimensional array as input and return nothing as output.
- Use this static method to display the matrix on the screen three times.
